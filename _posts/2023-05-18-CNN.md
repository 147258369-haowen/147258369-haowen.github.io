## Introduction
In the task of image recognition, convolutional neural network is the most important method. Unlike regular neural networks, the neurons in the layers of a convolutional neural network are arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, and depth. The width and height are not difficult to understand. The convolution itself is a two-dimensional template, **but the depth in the convolutional neural network refers to the third dimension of the activation data body, not the depth of the entire network**. The depth of the entire network Refers to the number of layers of the network.

## Structure

The convolutional neural network is mainly composed of these types of layers: **input layer, convolutional layer, ReLU layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer**. By stacking these layers together, a complete convolutional neural network can be built. In practical applications, the convolutional layer and the ReLU layer are often referred to as the convolutional layer, so the convolutional layer also needs to pass through the activation function after the convolution operation.

## Input layer

The input layer is used to describe the data of the input image, usually represented by a three-dimensional matrix, the first and second dimensions are the length and width of the picture, and the third dimension is the color channel (RGB) representing the picture. For grayscale images, there is only one layer of color channels. In order to make the input data better for training, the input pixel values are usually normalized or clipped.
## Convolutional layer

The convolutional layer is the core component of the entire convolutional neural network. The basic composition of the convolutional layer is many convolutional units, which optimize the model through continuous training using the backpropagation algorithm. The convolutional layer usually has multiple layers. The first convolutional layer usually extracts some low-level features, and the feature extraction of the later convolutional layers becomes more and more refined.
## Relu layer
The relu function is very important in convolutional neural networks and acts as a nonlinear transformation. It allows the neural network to fit complex systems by removing the negative values in the convolution results and leaving the positive values unchanged.

## Poolling layer

Due to the strong learning ability of the convolutional neural network, in order to reduce overfitting and retain key features, it is necessary to introduce a pooling layer. Common pooling layers include average pooling layer and maximum pooling layer

## Fully connected layer

Each neuron in the fully connected layer is fully connected to all neurons in the previous layer. The fully connected layer is usually used at the end of the entire neural network to map the output features to the specified label.
