# DDRM

## Introduction

The diffusion model is very popular recently, and many AIs that generate images based on text use the diffusion model

Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (DDPM) is a kind of deep generative model, which usually includes the diffusion process in both positive and negative directions. Markov chains in both directions consist of a finite number of time steps.

DDPM is mainly divided into two processes:

  - Noise process
  - denoising process

The process of adding noise refers to continuously adding Gaussian noise to make the data messy and disorderly, and the process of denoising refers to gradually denoising the image with added noise, so as to restore the real image. The noise-adding process can be realized through a certain mathematical algorithm, while the de-noising process uses a neural network model to learn features from massive data. In this way, the neural network model can generate real pictures from a bunch of messy and noisy pictures.

## Adding noise

This is the mathematical formula for forward propagation. From the formula on the figure, it can be seen that the process of adding noise lasts for T times, and a series of pictures with noise x1, x2...xT are generated. The standard deviation of the noise is fixed at 0 to a BT in the range of 1 to determine.

As t continues to increase, the original photo will continue to lose features. As T approaches infinity, the photo becomes unrecognizable, visually complete noise.

## reverse diffusion process

The inverse diffusion process is a process of sampling from Gaussian noise and learning a model to estimate the real conditional probability distribution. Of course, the distribution of any state can also be directly calculated, so it can be sampled directly, and then calculate the mean square error with the real image. The mean of the inverse process requires model prediction, but the variance uses a constant term
